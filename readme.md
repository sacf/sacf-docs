# sacf-docs

Generate docs for [sacf](https://github.com/sacf/sacf) from docblocks inside of the plugin. The docs are generated by doxygen.

## setup:

- this folder needs to be next to the sacf folder
- install doxygen via homebrew `brew install doxygen`
- `npm install` and `npm run mkdocs`
- or `npm run newdocs` to just create new docs and clean up after yourself
